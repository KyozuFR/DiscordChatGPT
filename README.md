# DiscordChatGPT
Allows you to use ChatGPT on your discord server (currently only available in French)


## Requirement
install python
install py-cord (pip install py-cord)
install openai (pip install openai)
Create a [Discord_bot](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started)
Create an [Openai_Api_Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)


## Functioning
change "your_api_key" to your api key and "your_discord_bot_token" to your token
invite the bot on your server and create a channel named "chatgpt" *(You can change it on line 27 in: "if message.channel.name != "chatgpt":")*

**!!!Be careful, the api is not free and if you have never used it you will probably consume your free trial. Check out: [openai_account_usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage)**
